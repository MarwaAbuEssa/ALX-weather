# Reflection on AI’s Impact in Building the Weather Dashboard

Building the weather dashboard project with the support of AI was both a productive and eye-opening experience. From the beginning, AI acted as a guide and assistant that helped me move quickly from concept to working code. Its impact was most visible in the speed of exploration, the ability to scaffold solutions, and the constant availability of examples that I could adapt to my context. At the same time, working with AI also highlighted some limitations, especially in areas where critical thinking and domain-specific judgment were required. Overall, the experience taught me not just technical lessons but also how to use prompting, reviewing, and iteration as part of an AI-assisted development workflow.

## What Worked Well

One of the things that worked particularly well was using AI for scaffolding and boilerplate code. For example, integrating the OpenWeatherMap API into the Node.js backend could have taken a lot of time to configure and debug, but the AI was able to generate a working example almost immediately. Similarly, when I needed to decide which Angular component would best represent weather states, AI provided clear guidance and examples of icons and integration patterns. These suggestions saved hours of trial and error and let me focus on tailoring the dashboard’s design and functionality.

AI was also very helpful when it came to documentation and Markdown formatting. Questions about how to add images to the `README.md`, how to use GitHub paths correctly, or how to present weather icons were answered quickly with precise code snippets. These seemingly small issues often slow down projects, but AI support meant I could resolve them in minutes. I found that AI excels at solving repetitive or well-structured problems, like writing configuration commands, handling Git errors, or providing example chart types for survey data visualization.

## Limitations

There were also moments where AI felt limiting. For instance, when I tried to identify songs from a video reel, the AI explained clearly that it could not process audio directly. In the coding context, I also noticed that while AI could generate working code, it sometimes produced solutions that were not fully optimized or did not match best practices for scalability. For example, when handling large files in Git, I needed to dig deeper into the errors and adapt the AI’s suggestions, because they were too general. This made me realize that AI is a powerful assistant, but not a replacement for human problem-solving and domain understanding.

## Lessons Learned

The biggest lesson I learned was about prompting, reviewing, and iterating. Clear, specific prompts produced much better results than vague requests. Asking *“How do I integrate OpenWeatherMap with my Node.js backend?”* worked far better than *“Help me with API integration.”* Similarly, reviewing AI output critically was essential. I always had to verify the code, test it in my environment, and sometimes re-prompt with clarifications or constraints. Iteration was the bridge between the two—each cycle of prompt, review, and refine brought me closer to the final solution.

## Conclusion

In conclusion, AI had a significant positive impact on my build process. It accelerated development, reduced friction, and provided on-demand guidance. At the same time, it required me to stay engaged, think critically, and learn how to communicate effectively with it. The weather dashboard project taught me that AI is most effective as a collaborator—one that extends my capabilities but still depends on my judgment to deliver a polished and reliable final product.
